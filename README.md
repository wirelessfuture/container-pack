# Container Pack
### Designed to enable estimated container size usage for various sized shipments
Based on enzoruiz's [py3dbp](https://github.com/enzoruiz/3dbinpacking) but modified so that the "right way up" principal is maintained. 

#### Supported Container Sizes (Based on [Hapag-Lloyd's Container List](https://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/products/fleet/container.html))
##### Standard
- 20" Standard
- 40" Standard
- 40" Standard High Cube
- 45" Standard High Cube

#### TODO List
